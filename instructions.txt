Premium E-Commerce • Frontend-First with Mock Backend

======================================================================
0. BRAND OVERVIEW (KEEP THIS CONTEXT IN ALL DESIGN DECISIONS)
======================================================================
Brand: Dolce Fiore

Brand Description:
"At Dolce Fiore, we create premium, handcrafted gift hampers rooted in health, sustainability, and conscious living.

- Sustainable textures (kraft paper, wood, marble, cotton, jute)
- Premium photography with natural light and editorial vibe
- Smooth, subtle animations (no flashiness)

Target Audience:
Premium, health-conscious, eco-aware customers and luxury gift buyers.

======================================================================
1. IMAGE HANDLING POLICY
======================================================================
Dolce Fiore is visually driven. Use high-quality images for both development
and production-ready UI structures.

For Development (Mock Data):
- Use Unsplash (primary) or Pexels (secondary).
- Only use premium, editorial-quality images (no cheap-looking photos).
- Prefer:
  - gourmet desserts
  - artisanal sweets
  - organic snacks
  - eco-friendly packaging (cloth, kraft paper, wooden trays, jute, glass jars)
  - warm, natural lighting
  - rustic food styling

Examples of search keywords:
- “organic sweets”
- “artisanal chocolate”
- “healthy snacks”
- “eco friendly packaging”
- “gift hamper”
- “gourmet desserts”
- “rustic food photography”

Image Storage Logic:
- MOCK mode → API returns Unsplash URLs.
- REAL backend → API returns CDN/public storage URLs (S3, Cloudflare R2, DO Spaces, etc.).

IMPORTANT:
The UI must NEVER care where the image comes from.
It must always receive image URLs through the API and render them directly.

Future Production Setup:
- Store real images in object storage (S3, R2, Spaces).
- Serve via CDN.
- API returns URLs only.

======================================================================
2. PROJECT SETUP (PHASE 0)
======================================================================
Goal:
Set up a clean React + TypeScript + Tailwind app with routing and structure.

Tasks:
1. Create project via Vite + React + TypeScript.
2. Install TailwindCSS, React Router, Zustand (optional), TanStack Query.
3. Set up folder structure something similar:

   src/
     app/             # root layout + router
     components/      # shared UI
     features/        # domain modules (catalog, cart, orders, auth)
     lib/
       api/           # API client + endpoints
       config/
     mocks/           # MSW handlers & sample JSON
     assets/          # stock images
     styles/

4. Set up routes:
   /                  Home
   /products          Product listing
   /products/:slug    Product detail
   /cart              Cart
   /checkout          Checkout
   /orders            My orders
   /auth/login        Login

  → Premium, elegant, editorial, perfect for luxury gifting.

Tailwind Theme:
- Add brand colors, spacing scale, typography scale.

Layout:
- Implement MainLayout with premium Navbar + Footer.
- Container component for centered, padded content.

Shared Components:
- Button (primary, secondary, ghost)

- SectionTitle
- Modal (optional)

Imagery placeholders:
- Use Unsplash premium-quality temporary images.
- Store them in /assets or reference them via URLs.

Done When:

======================================================================
4. DATA LAYER & MOCK API (PHASE 2)
======================================================================
Goal:
Prepare architecture for future Django backend using TypeScript models,
React Query, and MSW mock APIs.

TypeScript Models:
Product:
- id, slug, name, description
- price, currency="INR"
- category ("COOKIE" | "SNACK" | "CAKE" | "SWEET" | "HAMPER")
- images: string[]  (URLs only)
- tags: string[]  ("organic", "guilt-free", "eco-friendly", "artisan")
- is_available
- weight_grams?

CartItem:
- id
- product: Product
- quantity
- line_total

Order:
- id
- items: CartItem[]
- total
- status ("PLACED" | "PAID" | "PROCESSING" | "SHIPPED" | "DELIVERED")
- created_at

API Client (lib/api/client.ts):
- Wrapper around fetch/axios
- Uses BASE_URL from env
- get, post, etc.
- Returns parsed JSON
- No UI-level API calls

Endpoints (lib/api/endpoints/*.ts):
- catalog.ts → fetchProducts(), fetchProduct()
- cart.ts → getCart(), addToCart(), removeFromCart()
- orders.ts → getOrders(), placeOrder()
- auth.ts → login(), logout()

React Query:
- Wrap app in QueryClientProvider
- Hooks:
  useProducts(), useProduct(), useCart(), useOrders()

Mock Service Worker (MSW):
Implement handlers:
- GET    /api/products
- GET    /api/products/:slug
- GET    /api/cart
- POST   /api/cart
- DELETE /api/cart/:id
- POST   /api/orders
- GET    /api/orders
- POST   /api/auth/login
- POST   /api/auth/logout

Mock Data:
- Use UNSPLASH URLs for products & hampers.
- Include luxury hamper photography.
- Products should reflect Dolce Fiore values (organic, eco-friendly, guilt-free).

Done When:
- useProducts() fetches mock data from MSW.
- All data flows are functional with no real backend.

======================================================================
5. CORE PAGES & SHOPPING FLOW (PHASE 3)

   - Step 2: Delivery preferences + gift note (optional).
   - Step 3: Payment placeholder (mock success).
   - On success → placeOrder() → redirect.

6. Order Confirmation:
   - Clear thank-you message.
   - Order summary.

7. My Orders (/orders):
   - List previous orders.
   - Order status timeline.

8. Auth pages:
   - Simple mock login/signup to test flow.

Done When:
- User can browse → view product → add to cart → checkout → see confirmation.
- All using mock data.

======================================================================
6. PREMIUM POLISH & BRAND DEPTH (PHASE 4)
======================================================================
Goal:
Make the UI feel truly luxurious and brand-accurate.

Done When:
- The app looks premium, handcrafted, and polished.

======================================================================
7. PREP FOR DJANGO BACKEND (PHASE 5)
======================================================================
Goal:
Make frontend ready for real backend integration.

Tasks:
1. Ensure Django REST endpoints match:
   - URLs
   - JSON fields
   - Types defined in frontend

2. Switch VITE_API_BASE_URL to real backend.
3. Disable MSW in production.
4. Test all flows with real data.
5. Django should return CDN URLs for images.

Done When:
- Frontend works with real backend without major code changes.

======================================================================
8. GLOBAL BEST PRACTICES (APPLY THROUGHOUT)
======================================================================
- NEVER call fetch/axios directly in components—only use API client.
- Keep UI components presentational; put logic in hooks.
- UI must never assume image source (Unsplash vs CDN); always use URLs from API.
- Maintain strict file structure and naming consistency.
- Design mobile-first.
- Design mobile-first.
- Keep brand aesthetic consistent everywhere.
- Keep code modular and integration-friendly.
